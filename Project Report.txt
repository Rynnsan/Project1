Project Report

In this project, we get the remainder by subtracting the divisor from the dividing number. 
The number of ifJump loops give us the quotient. While doing this, we used 5 memory addresses. 
We used M1 and M2 to store dividend and divisor. M3 increased by 1 for each ifJump loop, giving
us the quotient. We used M5 to do the increment by 1. M4 is for determining the state of the 
ifJump loop. In the first five lines, we have assigned the memories to the registers in order
to do the operations.
